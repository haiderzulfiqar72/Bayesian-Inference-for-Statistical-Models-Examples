# Stan Modeling for Bayesian Analysis

This project involves a Bayesian analysis of automotive performance data to study the effects of various factors on vehicle performance. The data includes information on fuel efficiency (mpg) and other relevant variables such as cylinder count, weight, and horsepower. The primary goal is to use Bayesian statistical methods to infer posterior distributions for model parameters, allowing for uncertainty quantification and better decision-making.

The taks consists of three main questions:

Question 1: Analyzing the impact of different prior distributions (uniform and beta) on the posterior distribution of a parameter related to fuel efficiency.
Question 2: Investigating the effect of a drug on a medical condition by estimating a parameter and constructing a 95% credible interval.
Question 3: Performing a Bayesian regression analysis to understand the impact of cylinder count on fuel efficiency in automobiles.

The code provided includes Stan models, data fitting, posterior distributions plotting, and comments on the results obtained from the analyses. The project demonstrates the application of Bayesian statistical modeling and inference techniques in the context of automotive performance data.
